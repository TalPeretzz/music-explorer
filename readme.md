# ðŸŽ§ Music Explorer

You are required to create a Web application that shows a list of songs according to a search query, and allows you to mark them as Favorites.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Summary

Create a web application using React + TypeScript that allows users to:

1. Search for songs using the [Deezer Search API](https://api.deezer.com/search?q=eminem).
2. Add a search input and fetch the data according to the userâ€™s input.Show a list of the data returned from the API.
3. Clicking on the heart from the Search Results will add a show to favorites.
4. Clicking on the heart from My Favorites will remove a show from favorites.
5. The favorites list should remain when you refresh the browser, the search results should not.
There is no need to worry about pagination of the results.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Make sure the favorites update immediately upon interaction.
- Keep the UI clean and intuitive.
- Focus on the required functionality before adding extras.

**P.S.** If you face a CORS error when using the music API, you can switch to the TV Series API as an alternative:  
[Tvmaze Search API ](https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=friends)


Good luck! ðŸŽµ
