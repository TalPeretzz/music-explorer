# 🎧 Music Explorer (TypeScript) – React Interview Task

This is a starter project using TypeScript for a frontend interview task.

## 🎯 Task Summary

Create a web application using React + TypeScript that allows users to:

1. Search for songs using the [Deezer Search API](https://api.deezer.com/search?q=eminem).
2. Add or remove songs from a Favorites list using a ❤️ icon.
3. Store the Favorites list in `localStorage` so it persists across refreshes.
4. Display the search results and the list of favorited songs.
5. Keep the search results **non-persistent** between refreshes.

## 🧱 Folder Structure

- `src/components` – Place your React components here.
- `src/hooks` – Add any custom React hooks here.
- `src/` – Main entry and root-level files.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- You may use Vite, CRA, or any other boilerplate
- Optional: TailwindCSS / MUI / styled-components
